I have been wanting to learn more about software engineering and learning how to code for several years now.  I have always enjoyed the process of problem solving.  The good feelings that come from hunkering down and working on something that appeared to be an unfixable issue until you discover a solution are some of the best moments in life.  This type of mindset is why I went to school for accounting.  I thought I would enjoy the matching and problem solving aspects of this profession.  As I got further along into getting my masters degree and starting entry level jobs in the field I realized that the job was not what I expected in terms of providing this challenge in life that I looked for.  

I then went down the sales and entrepreneurship path as this appealed more to that side of me.  I enjoyed learning sales and the mission of the industry I was in, rooftop solar.  There were constanty challenges and new things were always needing to be learned in the birth of a new industry.  Was I progressed further along in the industry I started my own sales dealership company but the always changing regulations in the field made life a roller coaster with a very uncertain future.  I am also far more on the intoverted side of things and wanted to move away from sales.  

The idea of learning to code had always been on my to do list for the last 5 years after I graduated college but it was always put on the back burner due to various things coming up in life.  Last August I decided to finally leave the solar industry and commit to a new path of becoming a software engineer.  I got a tech sales job selling data labeling services for artificial intelligence projects so I could be fully immersed in this field.  After making the adjustment to this new job and industry I decided it was time to learn to code.  I enjoyed the free material online from places like freecodecamp.org but i felt like I needed to fully commit to a bootcamp if I was going to get serious and make the leap into being a software engineer.  I checked out a few different coding camps and Flatfiron School seemed like the best school for me.  I am loving this journey so far even if I am just at the beginning.  Going through the frustration of not understanding a bug until you come out the other side has been amazing so far and I can't wait to keep doing for the rest of my life.
